# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

# Contracts deployed to sepolia/goerli testnets
```
C:\Dido\web3\LimeChain\limechain-week3-library>npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia
The BookLibrary contract is deployed to 0xC97f3FD0A81432EaefF25DcCd8F32180E0437fcB


C:\Dido\web3\LimeChain\limechain-week3-library>npx hardhat deploy --network goerli
The BookLibrary contract is deployed to 0xDD7E44A7E8F5DD1bbA2a9A240732fa2fb51C5598
